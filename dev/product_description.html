	<h3>TOTAL CONTROL IN THE PALM OF YOUR HANDS</h3>

	<p>
		Camera-based security, monitored by you. Simplify and customize your business or home security by placing wireless, ceiling-mounted hidden cameras -- sensors -- anywhere in your building. One or several sensors can be installed and synced to one base station -- the brains of the system.
	</p>
	<p>
		When armed, the sensors (1) detect motion and take a picture, (2) trigger a siren on the base station, and (3) send a picture of the intrusion immediately to your smartphone. And with the press of a button, you decide whether or not to call the police.
